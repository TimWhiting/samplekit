## What is `preprocess-shiki`?

`preprocess-shiki` is a preprocessor for Svelte which allows you to write Shiki code blocks directly in Svelte templates.

It uses HTML comments so you don't have to worry about conflicts with your other tooling.

The [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@samplekit/preprocess-shiki) has a corresponding [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplekit.svelte-pp-shiki) to provide semantic highlighting.
